The rise ofthe on-demand economyposes diﬃcult questions forworkers, companies and politicians

I N THE  early 20th  centuryHenryFord combined moving assembly lines with  mass labour to  make  building cars
much  cheaper and  quicker—thus turning the  automobile from a rich man’s toy into trans-port for the  masses.  Today a growing group of entrepreneurs is striving to do the same to services, bringing together computer power with freelance workers to supply luxuries that were once reserved for the wealthy. Uber provides chauﬀeurs. Handy supplies cleaners. SpoonRocket delivers restaurant meals to your door. Instacart keeps your fridge stocked. In San Francisco a young computer programmer can already live like a princess. 

Yet this on-demand economy goes much widerthan the oc- casional luxury. Click on Medicast’s app, and a doctor will be knocking on your door within two hours. Want a lawyer or a consultant? Axiom will supply the former, Eden McCallum the latter. Other companies oﬀer prizes to freelances to solve R&D problems or to come up with advertising ideas. And a growing number of agencies are delivering freelances of all sorts, such as Freelancer.com and Elance-oDesk, which links up 9.3m workers for hire with 3.7m companies.

The on-demand economy is small, but it is growing quickly
(see pages17-20). Uber, founded in San Francisco in 2009, now
operates in 53 countries, had sales exceeding $1 billion in 2014
and a valuation of $40 billion. Like the moving assembly line,
the idea of connecting people with freelances to solve their
problems sounds simple. But, like mass production, it has pro-
found implications for everything from the organisation of
workto the nature ofthe social contract in a capitalist society. 

Baby, you can drive my car—and stockmy fridge
Some  of the  forces behind  the  on-demand  economy have
been around for decades. Ever since the 1970s the economy
that Henry Ford helped create, with big ﬁrms and big trade un-
ions, has withered. Manufacturing jobs have been automated
out of existence or outsourced abroad, while big companies
have abandoned lifetime employment. Some 53m American
workers already workas freelances. 

But two powerful forces are speedingthis up and pushing it
into ever more parts of the economy. The ﬁrst is technology.
Cheap computing power means a lone thespian with an Ap-
ple Mac can create videos that rival those of Hollywood stu-
dios. Complextasks, such as programminga computeror writ-
ing a legal brief, can now be divided into their component
parts—and subcontracted to specialists around the world. The
on-demand economy allows society to tap into its under-used
resources: thus Uber gets people to rent their own cars, and In-
noCentive lets them rent their spare brain capacity. 

The other great force is changing social habits. Karl Marx
said that the world would be divided into people who owned
the  means of production—the  idle  rich—and  people  who
worked for them. In fact it is increasingly being divided be-
tween people who have money but no time and people who
have time but no money. The on-demand economy provides a
way for these two groups to trade with each other.

This will push service companies to follow manufacturers
and focus on their core competencies. The “transaction cost”
of using an outsider to ﬁx something (as opposed to keeping
thatfunction within yourcompany) isfalling. Rather than con-
trolling ﬁxed resources, on-demand companies are middle-
men,  arranging connections and  overseeing quality.  They
don’t employ full-time lawyers and accountants with guaran-
teed pay and beneﬁts. Uber drivers get paid only when they
work and are responsible for their own pensions and health
care. Risksborne bycompaniesare beingpushed backon to in-
dividuals—and that has consequences for everybody.

Obamacare and Brand You
The on-demand economy is already provoking political de-
bate, with Uber at the centre of much of it. Many cities, states
and countries have banned the ride-sharing company on safe-
ty or regulatory grounds. Taxi drivers have staged protests
against it. Uber drivers have gone on strike, demanding better
beneﬁts. Techno-optimists dismiss all this as teething trouble:
the on-demand economygivesconsumersgreaterchoice, they
argue, while letting people workwhenever they want. Society
gains because idle resources are put to use. Most ofUber’s cars
would otherwise be parked in the garage. 

The truth is more nuanced. Consumers are clear winners;
so are Western workers who value ﬂexibility over security,
such as women who want to combine work with child-rear-
ing. Taxpayers stand to gain ifon-demand labouris used to im-
prove eﬃciency in the provision of public services. But work-
ers who  value  security over ﬂexibility,  including a  lot  of
middle-aged lawyers, doctors and taxi drivers, feel justiﬁably
threatened. And the on-demand economy certainly produces
unfairnesses: taxpayers will also end up supporting many
contract workers who have never built up pensions.

This sense of nuance should inform policymaking. Gov-
ernments that outlaw on-demand ﬁrms are simply handicap-
ping the rest of their economies. But that does not mean they
should siton theirhands. The waysgovernmentsmeasure em-
ployment and wages will have to change. Many European tax
systems treat freelances as second-class citizens, while Ameri-
can stateshave diﬀerentrulesfor“contractworkers” thatcould
be tidied up. Too much ofthe welfare state isdelivered through
employers, especially pensions and health care: both should
be tied to the individual and made portable, one area where
Obamacare was a big step forward. 

But even ifgovernments adjust theirpolicies to a more indi-
vidualistic age,  the  on-demand  economy clearly imposes
more risk on individuals. People will have to master multiple
skills if they are to survive in such a world—and keep those
skills up to date. Professional sorts in big service ﬁrms will
have to take more responsibility for educating themselves.
People will also have to learn how to sell themselves, through
personal networkingand social media or, ifthey are really am-
bitious, turning themselves into brands. In a more ﬂuid world,
everybody will need to learn how to manage You Inc.
